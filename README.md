This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

Pages to be scraped are listed in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C0FFS2EJYnnKNIP4hdt73sy7_9RIz70IvsYKoEt-Ebk/edit#gid=0)

A unique selector must be specified. The text contents of the selector are concatenated, keeping inline elements together and separating block elements with newlines. Diffs between successive runs are stored in a separate table.
