Scrapes the content of local council election pages.

Pages to be scraped are listed in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C0FFS2EJYnnKNIP4hdt73sy7_9RIz70IvsYKoEt-Ebk/edit#gid=0)

A unique selector must be specified.

The text contents of the selector are concatenated. Inline elements are kept together and block elements are separated with newlines.

Diffs between successive runs are stored in a separate table.
